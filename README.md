ArrayList Exercises:
Prerequisites:
Refer: Read the class description & the methods in the StringBuilder class javadoc
1. Write a program to create an ArrayList & print the size of it
2. Write a program to create an ArrayList & add 5 Strings from the command line to it. Print
the ArrayList & the size of it
3. Write a program to create an ArrayList & add 5 integers from the command line to it. Print
the ArrayList & the size of it
4. Write a program to create an ArrayList & add your custom objects to it. Print the ArrayList
& the size of it
5. Write a program to create an ArrayList & add 2 integers, add 3 Strings from command line
& 2 custom objects.Print the ArrayList & the size of it
6. Write a program to create an ArrayList & add 4 Strings from the command line to it. Then
find the index of any one of the already added String. Print the ArrayList & the size of it
as well.
7. Write a program to create an ArrayList & add 5 Strings from the command line to it. Use
the iterator method & for loop to print each element in the ArrayList
8. Write a program to create an ArrayList & add Strings from the command line to it. Print
the String at a given index in the ArrayList & the size of it
9. Write a program to create an ArrayList & add 5 Strings(with duplicates) from the
command line to it. Find the first & last position(index) of a duplicate string.
10. Write a program to create an ArrayList & add 5 Strings from the command line to it. After
that add a given String at the 2nd position of the ArrayList. Print the ArrayList & the size of
it as well.
11. Write a program to create an ArrayList(first ArrayList) & add 10 Strings from the command
line to it. Using that ArrayList create a new ArrayList(second ArrayList) with elements from
3 to 8 position of the first ArrayList
12. Write a program to create an ArrayList(first ArrayList) & add 3 Strings from the command
line to it. Create another ArrayList(second ArrayList) with 5 more Strings from the
Command line. Now create another ArrayList (third ArrayLIst) using the above two
ArrayLists. Print the third ArrayList & size of it. Note: You should not use a loop to create
a 3rd ArrayList.
13. Write a program to create an ArrayList(first ArrayList) & add 5 Strings from the command
line to it. Create another ArrayList(second ArrayList) with 3 more Strings from the
Command line. Now create another ArrayList (third ArrayLIst) using the above two
ArrayLists. But all the elements of secondArrayList should be ahead of the first ArrayList
elements. Print the third ArrayList & size of it. Note: You should not use a loop to create a
3rd ArrayList.
14. Write a program to create an ArrayList & add 5 decimal values from the command line to
it. Remove one of the decimal values from the ArrayList.Print the ArrayList & the size of it
as well.
15. Write a program to create an ArrayList & add 5 decimal values from the command line to
it. Remove a decimal value at position 4 from the ArrayList.Print the ArrayList & the size
of it as well.
16. Write a program to create an ArrayList & add 10 long values from the command line to it.
Remove long values from position 4 to 8 from the ArrayList.Print the ArrayList & the size
of it as well.Note: You should not use a loop to remove valuest.17. Write a program to create an ArrayList(first ArrayList) & add 5 Strings from the command
line to it. Create another ArrayList(second ArrayList) with the same 3 Strings in the
previous 5 Strings. Now remove the elements from the first ArrayList which are present in
the secondArrayList. Note: You should not use a loop to remove the elements. Print the
ArrayList & the size of it as well.
18. Write a program to create an ArrayList(first ArrayList) & add 5 Strings from the command
line to it. Create another ArrayList(second ArrayList) with the same 3 Strings in the
previous 5 Strings. Now remove the elements from the first ArrayList which are not
present in the secondArrayList. Note: You should not use a loop to remove the elements.
Print the ArrayList & the size of it as well.
19. Write a program to create an ArrayList & add 10 long values from the command line to it.
Remove all the long values from the ArrayLIst.Print the ArrayList & the size of it as well.
20. Write a program to create an ArrayList & add 5 String values from the command line to it.
Check whether a given String is present in the ArrayList.Print the ArrayList & the size of it
as well.
